# Hill Cipher

## Instructions
Once you start the program, simply enter a word or phrase. This phrase can only be letters and spaces. If you enter upper case letters, they will be converted to lower case.

## Description 
This is a working demo of Hill Cipher created in 1929. This is modeled after the original version which only used 26 uppercase letters. This program is written in Python and uses the NumPy library to do matrix calculations. This program can take in any length input as long as it is only letters and spaces. The key is generated randomly as long as it has an inverse and the determinate is not dividable by 2 or 13 (since we are only using lower case letters.
